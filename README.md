# TriviaApp

This app implements a quiz game where the user can answer trivia questions about a certain chosen topic.
The user can score points by answering questions correctly. When the last question is answered, a leaderboard will automatically be shown with the top ten highscores.
The user will automatically be added to the top 10 list if they had a good score, but their score will also always be shown below the leaderboard.
